# ‚òÄÔ∏è ClimateChangeForecastApp üåç
The ClimateChangeForecastApp explores the weather with our intuitive app, which presents two distinct views. The initial screen enables a quick city search to display its current weather and an accompanying 24-hour forecast. A dedicated "Details" view provides a deeper look, including data like humidity and wind direction, along with a curvy diagram that visually illustrates temperature changes over time for an easy-to-understand forecast. This app uses the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
